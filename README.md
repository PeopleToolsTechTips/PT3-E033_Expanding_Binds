PeopleCode has two little gem functions that expand binds: ExpandBindVar and ExpandSqlBinds.

At first glance, these two functions look similar.  A cursory glance at PeopleBooks show that they both expand binds in strings.  Even the parameter list is the same (not).   But they are used is two very different situations and are not interchangeable.
